## DEPENDENCIES

GoogleCL requires Python 2.5 or 2.6 and the gdata python client library.

You can get the library from the project homepage:
    [project homepage](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)

The installation directions for the client library should also contain
directions on installing Python, if you don't have it already.

### INSTALLING GOOGLECL

Short instructions:
From the command line, in the directory as this file, run

```bash
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

or

```bash
$ python setup.py install --home=~
```
 (remember to set your PYTHONPATH to include your home directory if you do it this way)

For more detailed instructions, I recommend looking at the gdata-python-client
INSTALL.txt file. It also has instructions on modifying PYTHONPATH.
