#Google CL

[![Downloads](https://pypip.in/d/google_cl/badge.png)](https://crate.io/package/google_cl)

GoogleCL is a command line utility to use google services like youtube
blogger etc.

It was built by Tom H. Miller from Google. Originally the project
was hosted here [googlecl](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/). Since
there is no development going there, I forked the project to
github to pace up development.


## Installation

Installation is simple, Just run this command in your shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinitkumar/googlecl.git
cd googlecl
python setup.py install
```

## Contribution:

Few things should be kept in notice before contributing:

- Few changes in the documentation structure and format(Markdown) has
been done.
- Pycco has been used to generate documentation. I believe in Literate
programming and felt that it would be easier for developers to
understand the existing code.
- Follow the same styleguide and naming conventions as present in the
code.
- Follow [github flow] (http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/), It is
a dead simple way to deal with development using and I prefer it.
- Branch naming could be issue related. Say there is issue #23, create a
branch name feature/fix-issue23 or bugfix/issue23. It would really help.


Thanks!
