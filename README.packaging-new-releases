Steps that we take when doing releases (so we don't forget)

===Tarball===
All instructions assume a current working directory of trunk
1) Be sure changelog is up to date. Check the commit messages for important bug fixes, enhancements, features, etc.
2) Increment version number in changelog and README.new-usage (change "svn HEAD" to "version x.x.x")
3) Be sure man pages are up to date.
4) Update VERSION variable in src/google
5) Update version keyword argument in setup.py
6) cp src/google.py src/google ; chmod 755 src/google
7) Regenerate man page per instructions in src/google
8) Commit all these changes with a message like "Change to x.x.x" or "Committing updated version numbers x.x.x"
9) Use setup.py sdist to make the source distribution
10) cd dist ; tar xf googlecl-x.x.x.tar.gz ; cd googlecl-x.x.x/
11) chmod 755 src/google (sdist apparently sets whatever permissions it feels like)
12) When you're convinced it's correct, use svn copy to tag the release:
 $ svn copy https://googlecl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://googlecl.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-x.x.x -m "x.x.x release"
13) Update release at pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/googlecl/

===Debian package===
Our .deb build currently uses git-buildpackage with a private git repo (sorry, hackers).

===Windows executable===
Note: This will only work from a windows machine with py2exe installed. You MUST use Python 2.5
1) Run 'cmd' to get a terminal
2) cd to the src directory of the repository, where win_setup is.
3) Copy google.py to google.
4) Run "C:\path\to\python25\python.exe win_setup.py py2exe -O2" That's a capital "o", then a 2
5) LEGAL WORRY: After py2exe does its thing, ***REMOVE MSVCR71.dll*** from the newly created dist/
6) Copy trunk/README.txt and trunk/README.config into dist/
7) Rename dist/ to googlecl (or what have you) and zip it up.

On legal worries: As far as I can tell, it is a breach of the EULA to distribute that DLL unless you own a license for Microsoft Visual C++, which I do not. Users that need it can follow the instructions on the wiki's SystemRequirements page
